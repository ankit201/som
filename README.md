## Credit Card Fraud

This is a project based on deep learning model Self Organised maps. Here we take a clean dataset of all the customers who applied for the credit card in the bank and we found out whichh person is a fraud and who cheated. The model we make is a unsupervised deep learning model so it just tells us if the customer cheated or not
